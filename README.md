# Restful Routes Basic Lab

## Objectives

- Build RESTful routes to create, show, edit, and delete items from the
  database

## Instructions

Instead of keeping all your recipes on index cards (just like your grandma
did!), we're going to be building a web app to store those recipes for you!

6.  Create a controller action (index action) that displays all the recipes in
    the database.

7.  Add to the recipe show page a form that allows a user to delete a recipe.
    This form should submit to a controller action that deletes the entry from the
    database and redirects to the index page.
